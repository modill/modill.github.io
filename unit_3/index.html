	<p class="paragraph">I've been obsessed with sports my entire life. Since my athletic ability does not quite match my passion, it only felt natural to pursue a career off the courts. Take a look around, explore some of my favorite articles, and don't hesitate to reach out! I travel a lot to cover the day's most exciting matchups and am always to a city's best divebar recommendation.</p>
